# YKB Solutions

YKB Solutions Inc. is a career consulting firm committed to helping people transition from one career track to another. YKB was founded by college-senior [Michael Mei](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-h-mei/) back in 2017 at UC Santa Cruz as campus-wide career services for students transitioning from school to early-career was limited in scope across campus. Today, YKB serves as a means for its clients to leave their dead-end jobs to build new careers for themselves.

This GitHub repository is the official full-stack deployment of YKB Solutions' website using a React.js frontend and Mongo backend for data storage, all to be hosted on AWS servers. Email services are rendered through EmailJS.

Navigate to 'components' branch to see where most of the work is being done.
