# YKB Solutions Inc.

YKB Solutions Inc. is a career consulting firm committed to helping people transition from one career track to another. YKB was founded by college-senior [Michael Mei](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-h-mei/) back in 2017 at UC Santa Cruz as campus-wide career services for students transitioning from school to early-career was limited in scope across campus. Today, YKB serves as a means for its clients to leave their dead-end jobs to build new careers for themselves.

This GitHub repository is the official deployment of YKB Solutions' website using a React.js front-end. This project is purely a front-end project.

## Future Development

As of right now, we need to figure out how to enable the contact section to send emails to a specified email address. Previous solutions for previous projects have not worked before, so currently looking for an emailing solution so that potential clients can get in direct touch with Michael.

We will need to come up with a clean and professional theme to build YKB's brand and character. Might consider looking to contract bootcamp classmates to handle the front-end.
