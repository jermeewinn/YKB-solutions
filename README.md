# YKB Solutions Inc.

YKB Solutions Inc. is a career consulting firm committed to helping people transition from one career track to another. YKB was founded by college-senior [Michael Mei](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-h-mei/) back in 2017 at UC Santa Cruz as campus-wide career services for students transitioning from school to early-career was limited in scope across campus. Today, YKB serves as a means for its clients to leave their dead-end jobs to build new careers for themselves.

This GitHub repository is the official full-stack deployment of YKB Solutions' website using a React.js frontend and AWS backend for data storage.

## Future Development

There are a few things we are planning on implementing into the web app:

- Enable the contact section to send emails to ykbcoaching@gmail.com upon clicking the submit button.
- Refactor the testimonials components so that client use-cases can be opened w/i a modal and maintain SPA viability while showing as much information as possible.
- Restyle footer section so that the website is easy to navigate at a glance.
- Enable users the ability to create an account with us, login/logout functions for said accounts. Logged-in users will be able to access schedule their first career consultation with us for free through Calendly. Paying customers can schedule follow-up meetings with us through Calendly as need be.
- Figure out a way to create dropdown menus from within the NavBar at the top of the page.
- Figure out a way to refactor component file structure so that child components are less confusing to identify and associate with their parent components.
